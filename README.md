# bruteforce_test

This is test program for making bruteforce on websites using python

Passwords.txt file that I uploaded is weak but you can dowload much bigger passwordlist on the internet or you can make it on your own. 

username and password values might be different on website login pages , so you have to change it if needed be.

to use on terminal;
 *python3 bruteforce.py
